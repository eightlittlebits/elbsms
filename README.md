## what

A Sega Master System emulator in C#

## why

I enjoy the challenge of writing emulators and the master system was one of the first consoles that I ever owned and played. 

Will it be the best emulator in the world? Probably not, I don't have the hardware knowledge (yet, maybe) to do any real investigation myself but I'll do the best with what I do know. And hey, it doesn't need to be the best.
